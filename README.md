## Overview:
The algorithm is designed to identify top-performing stocks from the S&P 500 based on several technical indicators. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

## 1. Data Collection:
   - The algorithm starts by fetching a list of S&P 500 companies from a Wikipedia page.
   - It then retrieves historical stock price data for these companies using a financial data service.
## 2. Technical Analysis:
   - For each stock, the algorithm calculates several technical indicators:
      - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): Helps identify potential buy/sell signals.
      - RSI (Relative Strength Index): Measures the stock's recent trading strength.
      - Bollinger Bands: Indicates volatility and potential price reversal points.
      - Moving Averages (50-day and 200-day): Shows the average stock price over short and long terms.
      - Stochastic Oscillator: Compares a stock's closing price to its price range over a period.
## 3. Performance Evaluation:
   - The algorithm evaluates the stock's recent performance based on these indicators.
   - It assigns a score to each stock based on:
      - Number of days MACD is positive/negative.
      - RSI values below 70.
      - Price positions relative to Bollinger Bands and Moving Averages.
      - Stochastic Oscillator values below 80.
## 4. Top Stocks Selection:
  - The stocks with the highest scores are identified as the top-performing stocks.
## 5. Result Presentation:
  - The algorithm outputs the top stocks and their recent performance data for review.
